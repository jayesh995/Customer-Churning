# Customer-Churning
A dataset is provided by the ABC food company on which I have to perform Analysis.
Business Problem: The company sees that few people have stopped purchasing items from their website or store, which means customers are churning. At the same time, Customer churning is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a specific time frame. So the company wants to understand what kind of customers are churning. So that they can focus on those people/customers to retain.
